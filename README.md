# Project Idea: OpenAdvisor

## Description
OpenAdvisor is an open-source, ML-based stock selection advisory platform designed to help investors make informed decisions. It provides personalized stock recommendations based on user preferences, risk tolerance, and historical market data.

## Key Features
1. **User Profile Setup**:
   - Users can create profiles detailing their investment goals, risk tolerance, and preferences.
   
2. **AI-Driven Recommendations**:
   - An AI engine analyzes historical market data and user profiles to suggest personalized stock picks.
   
3. **Historical Market Data**:
   - Use publicly available datasets to provide historical stock data for analysis.
   
4. **Portfolio Tracking**:
   - Users can track their investments and get insights on portfolio performance.

## Technologies
- **Frontend**: Tailwind CSS, DaisyUI, Alpine.js for a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **Backend**: Python (Flask) for handling user authentication, data processing, and API endpoints.
- **Database**: SQLite for storing user data, portfolio configurations, and market data.
- **ML Libraries**: TensorFlow or PyTorch for developing the recommendation engine.
- **Visualization Libraries**: Chart.js for creating interactive data visualizations.
- **Public Datasets**: Utilize open financial datasets for market data and historical performance.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Initial Setup**:
   - Set up the project repository, initialize the backend framework, and create the frontend structure.
   
2. **User Authentication**:
   - Implement user registration, login, and profile management.
   
3. **Historical Data Integration**:
   - Import and process historical stock data from public datasets.
   
4. **Recommendation Engine**:
   - Develop the AI model to analyze user data and historical trends for stock recommendations.
   
5. **Portfolio Management**:
   - Build features for users to add, track, and analyze their investments.

## Potential Challenges
- Ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the AI-driven recommendations.
- Efficiently processing and analyzing large volumes of historical data.
- Maintaining user data privacy and security.
